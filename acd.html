    <p class="paragraf"><strong>Când toamna vine,copiii încep școală și se întâlnesc cu colegi trecuți.
Toamna frunzele copacilor sunt mai închise la culoare și cad repede la adierea vântului .
Unele animale încep hibernarea (ursul) si alte animale .
Încep ploile si schimbările anotimpului toamna.Cad frunzele copacilor leganandu-se in aer ca niste fluturasi.Sunt zile in care ploua mult.Pe jos se formeaza un covor multicolor de frunze.Pasarelele isi iau zborul catre tarile soarelui.Fiecare anotimp semnifica ceva,de aceea eu le ador!</strong></p>

	The Minions are small, yellow, cylindrical creatures, who have one or two eyes. They are the signature characters of the Despicable Me series. They bring much of the comedy in the film, and they are known as the scene-stealer of the movie.

<p style="color: red; font-size: 24 px;">
	 Frequently, they speak in an incomprehensible language, called Minionese, occasionally switching to English. They are much childish in some ways, yet they seem to be very intelligent in certain aspects. All the minions are supporting characters in Minions (with the exception of Kevin, Stuart, and Bob),

	They are impulsive creatures with little self-control, but with a wide-eyed wonder and odd innocence that endears them to viewers and makes them relatable.
